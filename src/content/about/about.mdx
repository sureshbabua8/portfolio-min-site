I'm a rising senior at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, studying math, computer science, and statistics.  I'm passionate about learning new skills and serving the community with open source projects.

I'm experienced in backend, Android, and web development, and currently developing my data visualization acumen! I have a strong passion for theoretical computer science, particularly with automata, algorithms, and big data. I hope to continue expanding my expertise in these fields and finding new ways to apply my knowledge into my work.
