I'm a rising junior at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, studying math, computer science, and statistics.  I'm passionate about serving the community, learning new skills, and working on various open source projects.  

I'm experienced in backend and Android development, and currently honing in on my front-end skills!  I love algorithms and all forms of theoretical computer science; I hope to continue expanding my expertise in these fields and finding new ways to apply my knowledge into my work.
