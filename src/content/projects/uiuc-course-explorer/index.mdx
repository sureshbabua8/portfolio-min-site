Building an Android app that allows UIUC students to search, view, and rate courses.  Built and Dockerized REST API wrapper using Kotlin's ktor server-side framework.

I'm currently defining the app's UI components with FB Litho, an open-source Android UI alternative that follows a React-based methodology.
