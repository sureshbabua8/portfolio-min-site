Working with Pecan, an automated theorem prover written in Python that uses on BÃ¼chi automata to create logical statements. 
Currently working to characterize the Frobenius number of the Thue-Morse and Wythoff sequences by generating Pecan evaluations. 
The characterization also involves developing a Fibonacci automata to use Zeckendorf representation in the Wythoff sequences, which precludes the need to use an Ostrowski numeration system.
