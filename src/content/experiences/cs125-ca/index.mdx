Developing full-stack machine project for Fall 2020 students.  This machine project consists of an Android app and backend codebase for a REST API (written in Kotlin).

Testing Android development with JUnit, ShadowMocker, and Roboelectric, building UI with Facebook's Litho API.  Will write documentation to guide students' semester-long progress
as they rebuild the Android Studio front-end.
