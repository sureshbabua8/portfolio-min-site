**Summer 2020**

Developed, tested, and deployed a client-agnostic REST API.  This API is used to automate communications between insurance vendors and Capital One agents, 
as well as retrieve existing insurance documents from internal systems.  The API was integrated with Kafka streams to create products that are sent to a database.

Built an AWS Textract proof-of-concept as a model for OCR pipeline of insurance documents.  Reduced potential cost of total loss title release process by 74%.
