**Summer 2020**

Developed, tested, and deployed a client-agnostic REST API for the total loss process.  This API is used to automate communications between insurance vendors and Capital One agents, 
as well as retrieve existing insurance documents from the internal mainframe.  The API was integrated with a Kafka SDP listener to create backend products that are then sent to the backend database.

Built an AWS Textract proof-of-concept as a model for OCR pipeline of insurance documents.  Improved efficiency of total loss title release by 50 percent, cost by 74%.
